# Network-Theory-Project

During the time of making this analysis, the teacher Didier Gamboa made us think before looking at the results of my investigations. 
He suggested to ask to ourselfs the following questions:

•What was your expectation?
•How do the results compare to your expectations?
•What did you learn from each quantity?

Now, with the project at his end and the document ready, the only thing left to do is to answer the questions.

- My expectations where... normal, the videos and analysis we did in class where good, and to be honest, it set the bar not to high and not to low
  this made me believe that a project might have as little nodes like Zachary's Karate Club Network with 32 nodes. To the current one im working Social circles: Facebook with 4k nodes.
  The important thing is to understand this networks, they meaning behind all this work and how to apply it, no matter the nodes.
- As mention before, the bar was at the perfect spot. So I'll have to say that my expectations where surpased by working by myself in a fun project as this one.
- To be honest, it is a lot, no matter how many classes one might take, the real experience comes from here, and things such as nodes, families clusterings etc where almost
  daunting at first, but in the end it turn to be okay.
